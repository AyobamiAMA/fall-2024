    <br>
    They flee from me, that sometime did me seek</br>
    <br> With naked foot stalking*&nbsp;in my chamber.</br>                            
    <br> I have seen them gentle, tame, and meek</br>
    <br> That now are wild and do not remember</br>                               
    <br> That sometime they put themself in danger</br>
    <br> To take bread at my hand; and now they range,</br>
    <br> Busily seeking with continual change. </br>
  </p>
  <p>  
    <br>
    Thanked be fortune it hath been otherwise</br>
    <br>Twenty times better; but once in special,</br>                            
    <br>In thin array, after a pleasant guise,</br>
    <br>When her loose gown from her shoulders did fall,</br>
    <br> And she me caught in her arms long and small,*</br>                
    <br>  Therewithal* sweetly did me kiss</br>                                         
    <br> And softly said, Dear heart, how like you this?</br>                    
 </p>
 <p> 
    <br>
    It was no dream, I lay broad waking.</br> 
    <br> But all is turned, thorough* my gentleness,</br>                          
    <br>Into a strange fashion of forsaking;</br> 
    <br>And I have leave to go, of her goodness,</br> 
    <br>And she also to use newfangleness.*</br>                             
    <br>But since that I so kindly am served,</br> 
    <br>I fain would know what she hath deserved</br>
    </p>
