      <h1>Resolved in Fragmentation</h1>
      <br>
      <h2>Curated by Ayobami Adegbite</h2></br>
      <p>
        This exhibition examines the paradox of artworks that are both unfinished and complete, 
        exploring how incompleteness becomes an integral part of their final form. Joan Heemskerk 
        and Dirk Paesmans, as Jodi, created fragmented, glitchy interfaces in the mid-1990s that 
        disrupt user expectations, turning digital errors into a finished artistic experience. Pete 
        Gomes' <em>Loop</em> (1998) is a collaborative web project that embraced perpetual evolution, 
        where each participant’s contribution added to a continually unfinished yet cohesive whole. 
        <em>Déclin Séquence</em> exemplifies this theme with its 31 individually styled 
        <code>&lt;time&gt;</code> elements, representing each day of October 2020, where the interplay 
        between daily updates and the slider’s browsing options blurs the line between process and completion. 
        These works challenge traditional notions of artistic finality.
