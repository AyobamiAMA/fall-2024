    <h2>Your Hot Coffee is Ready!</h2>
    <p>You are someone who finds beauty in the small, often-overlooked moments, appreciating life’s quiet and comforting pleasures. Like the soft blend of milk and espresso, you are grounded yet sweet, with a warm approach to everything you do. You move through life with a gentle confidence, savoring the harmony between simplicity and elegance. Your natural warmth invites others in, making them feel at ease in your presence.</p>
    
    <p>In your journey, you instinctively add sweetness to every experience, making ordinary moments feel special. Just like the smooth foam that tops a latte, your personality is layered with subtle richness, blending kindness and optimism. You don’t rush, instead choosing to sip life slowly, enjoying the connections and quiet joys that come your way.</p>
